Constitutions provide a charter for governance in that sense, they constitute the Government, they constitute the State.
(define the powers, the limits and the structures of government)

The Constitution of India follows a different tradition from that of an absolute monarchy as it places limits 
and constraints on what the State can do.

Constitutionalism seeks to limit what the Government can do.

Since the Constitution limits what the people today can get their government to do, Constitutions are undemocratic.

what the Constitution does is, it makes it very difficult to amend the Constitution. 
The Constitution is much more difficult to amend compared to ordinary laws. And that is both to ensure that that the limits 
are observed and also to give the Constitution some longevity, so that the underlying  structures of the 
State have some stability.
If every government, every 5 years could change the very fundamentals of the State, then we would 
have a lot of instability
